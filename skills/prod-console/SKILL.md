description: "Run a guarded production primitive directly from a brain checkout via rc dev console: SQL/schema read, rare dry-run-first SQL write, workspace bash, cataloged script, action preflight/run, exact mirror refresh. Use when a query, script, or action must be checked against production without wrapping it in an LLM run."

# prod-console — direct production primitives

Verbs and flags live in one home: [docs/rc-cli.md](../../docs/rc-cli.md) and `rc dev console <cmd> --help`.
This file is the decision logic around them.

Public `rc` only — never private RootCause repos, host shells, SSM, or registry SQL
([docs/support-boundary.md](../../docs/support-boundary.md)). Scope comes from `.rootcause.toml`, the
active OAuth login, and optional `--project` / `--tenant`.

**Console vs `rc ask`:** console primitives answer "does this query/script work?" directly and fast.
`rc ask` wraps them in an LLM run — keep it for full-loop behavior validation, ambiguous
investigations, and customer-style simulations.

## Required Context

- [docs/side-effects.md](../../docs/side-effects.md) — what is read-only and what is not.
- [docs/brain-model.md](../../docs/brain-model.md), [docs/mirrors.md](../../docs/mirrors.md).

## Workflow

1. **Discover before guessing.** `rc dev console capabilities` is the manifest: databases, cataloged
   scripts, actions, and which console planes this login actually has. `rc project connection ls`
   adds OAuth/API grants.
2. **Freshness.** A missing pushed script or stale `/brain` → `rc dev brain status` / `rc dev brain
   sync` (sync expires warm bash workspaces, so the next run remounts). A pushed mirror commit that
   must be visible now → `rc dev mirror refresh --repo <name> --expect-sha $(git rev-parse HEAD)`,
   once per affected project; success proves that exact commit is mounted. Never restart Docker.
3. **Database.** `rc dev console database list` is the authoritative view of which DSNs exist and
   connect; `rc project database ls` only shows the annotated ones. A database missing from `list`
   is not registered — seal `<PROJECT>_<DBKEY>_DSN`, then annotate
   ([docs/secrets.md](../../docs/secrets.md#register-a-new-grounding-database)).
   Query failing on a column name → stop and read `schema --table`, do not keep guessing.
   Bind values with repeated `--param`, never string interpolation. Analysis over more than a
   preview belongs in a local script over a complete `--all` export —
   [`rc-script-wrapper`](../rc-script-wrapper/SKILL.md).
4. **Workspace files.** `rc dev console bash run` is the exec plane; prefer a cataloged script
   (`bash list`) over raw bash. Logs are reached through the same plane
   (`python -m lib.cloudwatch …`), not a separate verb. `/kb` holds synced knowledge-base articles,
   `/brain/knowledge` the brain's own — filters in
   [docs/knowledge-base.md](../../docs/knowledge-base.md).
5. **Actions.** `list` / `show` / `preflight` are read-only; `run` is a real state-changing
   execution on the project's own production. Run it only when the user asked for execution or the
   task plainly requires it and params are grounded; report the action-run id, status, and result.
   For history across runs (stored params, originating run links) use `rc fleet actions` —
   [`rc-fleet`](../rc-fleet/SKILL.md).

## Side effects — the two that are not read-only

**SQL writes.** `--write` uses the project's sealed write-plane DSN and COMMITs (scope
`console:db:write`; project-level only — a tenant-bound request is refused). Discipline, because
there is no undo:

1. rehearse with `--write --dry-run` and a `RETURNING` list covering the key and every changed
   column (`RETURNING *` for deletes, so the removed row can be archived);
2. stop on any unexpected affected-row count;
3. rerun the identical statement without `--dry-run` — the two runs are separate executions, so
   confirm the count still matches.

**`action run`.** See step 5 and [docs/actions.md](../../docs/actions.md).

## Preflight is not a scope gap

`preflight` honours `--tenant` and runs in the same tenant-scoped grounding workspace a run gets
(scoped `*_DSN`, `RC_TENANT_*` stamped, no action/write credential). So a "record N not found" from
a console preflight means the grounding data no longer holds N — not a scope or env gap — even if a
run saw N earlier. Confirm with `rc dev console bash run --tenant <slug>` + `lib.db` before
suspecting the console.

## Brain-script catalog convention

Host contract (`rootcause` parses it): comment metadata in the **first 40 lines** of a
`skills/*/scripts/*.py|.sh` file makes the script discoverable through `rc dev console bash list` and
`capabilities`.

```python
# name: invoice_lookup
# purpose: Find invoice/payment state for a customer-visible invoice id.
# args: --invoice-id <id>
# required_env: APP_DSN, STRIPE_API_KEY
```

`description` is accepted as an alias for `purpose`. Keep names stable and env names only — the
script body stays the source of truth for behavior.

## Close-out

Report what ran, the scoped project/tenant, the material result, and the next command worth running.
Always distinguish a rolled-back dry-run from a committed write, and preflight-only from executed.
