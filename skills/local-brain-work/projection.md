# Tenant projection — what `/brain` will look like

The Local Brain Work view of tenant projection, for an agent editing a templated shared brain. Broader
model: [docs/brain-model.md](../../docs/brain-model.md).

## The invariant

For a templated project brain the model does **not** see the committed source tree. The host renders an
ephemeral per-tenant view and mounts *that* read-only at `/brain`. So reviewing the templates is not
reviewing what the tenant reads.

Committed source: `projection.yaml` (placeholders, branch selectors, variants, defaults, gated files),
markdown templates carrying `{{ placeholder }}` / `<!-- rc:branch -->`, and `tenant.schema.json`.
Runtime input: the tenant profile record in the rootcause DB (`rc project tenant profile get`).
Output: a throwaway compiled directory — never committed, never pushed, never durable knowledge.

`tenant.schema.json` is the **contract, not the values**: it validates `rc project tenant profile set`
and renders both `rc project tenant profile schema` and the operator Configuration form. A project
without one has no tenant-settings surface at all. Values live in the DB; the schema stays committed.

## Authoring rules

Get three things in view before editing: `projection.yaml`, `rc project tenant profile schema -o json`,
`rc project tenant profile get <slug> -o json`.

- Every placeholder used in markdown must be declared in `projection.yaml` and backed by a tenant value
  or a projection default.
- A branch selector matches the **exact rendered string** of its value (`true`/`false` for a bool, the
  decimal form for an integral number). Unmatched → the branch `default`; no default → the region is
  dropped.
- Reserved variant `unset` = absent, null, or blank/whitespace-only string. Reserved variant `present` =
  catch-all for "the tenant filled this in", so free-text keys can gate prose without enumerating
  values. `false` and `0` are values, hence present; only emptiness is `unset`. Exact-value variants win
  over `present`.
- Pair `present` with an **empty** `unset` body so an unconfigured section — heading included —
  disappears, instead of reading a "(not configured)" default out loud to the customer:

  ```yaml
  cancellation_policy: { select: cancellation_policy, variants: [present, unset], default: unset }
  ```

## Previewing

`brain_projection.py --tenant <slug>` is a local preview/audit helper, not a second source of truth: it
reads local `projection.yaml`, fetches tenant values via `rc`, and prints what production *would*
compile (settings version, branch choices, defaults used, gated files kept/dropped). `--write-summary`
persists only the summary + settings snapshot under gitignored `.rootcause/projection/<tenant>/`. It
must never write compiled files into the brain tree, commit tenant values, or teach the model to pick
variants itself.

`rc dev brain render --project <p> --tenant <slug>` returns the **server-compiled** view,
exactly as `/brain` mounts it, with a header of sha/channel/fill/branch/degradation counts. Pin
`--sha`/`--channel`; `--all` for the whole tree. Artifacts are keyed by tenant only
(`.rootcause/output/brain-render-<tenant>/`), so a second render of another sha overwrites the first —
move it aside to compare. Needs a project-level login.

Template-editing flow: author → `render` for 1–2 representative tenants ("what does this tenant read")
→ `rc dev brain preflight` ("would this commit break anyone", pass/fail across all tenants) → publish
(`brain-publish`). For full production confidence, `rc ask --brain-ref dev/x` with a login bound to the
target tenant, then inspect the dump.
