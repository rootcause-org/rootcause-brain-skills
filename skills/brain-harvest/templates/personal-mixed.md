# Archetype: personal / mixed mailbox

A personal or mixed inbox (the bollen-klara shape): many unrelated topics, no single product, heavy
triage need, and privacy-sensitive threads. The brain leans on a triage skill + per-case files +
distilled patterns + an explicit escalation/privacy policy. Edit this skeleton; delete unused sections.

AGENTS.md                     # router: which case file / pattern answers which kind of message
terminology.md                # names, recurring correspondents' roles, shorthand (distilled, not raw)

## Triage skill (skeleton)

State the draft/skip/escalate rationale in `skills/triage/SKILL.md`, but keep **deterministic** rules
and **broad guidance** in RootCause triage settings — the brain skill explains the *why*, the triage
surface enforces the *what*. Configure settings from the local authenticated control plane; do not put
control-plane commands in runtime instructions.

## Escalation + privacy (skeleton)

- Sensitive topics that must never auto-draft (health, legal, finances, minors): `<list>`.
- Always-escalate-to-human senders/subjects: encode as deterministic triage settings.
- Redaction rule: distilled patterns only — see the skill's privacy gate. `brain_lint.py` enforces it.

## What goes where (do not misfile)

- **Persona settings**: voice, warmth, signature, language.
- **Triage settings**: draft/skip/escalate decisions, deterministic sender/subject rules.
- **Brain files**: case runbooks, terminology, escalation criteria, distilled patterns.

State the runtime boundary near the top of `AGENTS.md`: production has `bash` plus its scenario
terminal tool, no `rc` binary, and read-only `/brain`; ground through `/brain` scripts and injected
`lib.*` capabilities.

Privacy is acute here: personal mail carries credentials, addresses, health data. No raw thread bodies
reach a brain file, ever. If legacy onboarding committed raw mail, the history-rewrite decision is the
operator's — do not silently `git rm`.
