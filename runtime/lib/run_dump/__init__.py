"""Shared run-dump renderer — the ONE index + JSONL formatter, brain-side.

A run-dump turns ONE agent run into two files: a concise markdown **index** (sized for an agent or a
hurried human deciding WHERE to look) and a jq-queryable **JSONL** event log (the drill-down target,
one untruncated JSON object per tool call). This module is the single source of truth for that
rendering, imported by BOTH consumers so their output is provably byte-identical:

  * the project-dev path — `skills/brain-dev/scripts/brain_dump.py` here, fed by the public-API
    bundle (`rc run <id> --full -o json`);
  * the operator path — rootcause's `rc_agent_debug.py`, fed by its SSM/DB query.

Both normalize their source to the **bundle dict** (`{"run": {...}, "events": [...]}`) defined in the
server spec (`rootcause/docs/specs/brain-test-runs.md`, Change 4) and hand it here. The server
ships raw truth; this module decorates it — the `disp`/`label`/`P1,P2…` computation, anomaly flags,
and "files read" extraction are presentation, computed here, never by the server.

It lives in `rootcause-runtime` (not the prod run image, which never imports it) so both consumers
pull identical bytes via the existing git-tag pin — the same anti-drift mechanism `lib` uses. It is
**pure stdlib** and is NOT imported by any grounding/run path.

Bundle contract (what this renderer reads — see the server spec for the producing endpoint):

    bundle = {
      "run": {
        "run_id", "project", "status", "kind", "trigger", "brain_ref", "error",
        "thread_id", "session_id", "topic", "question",
        "warm_start_digest", "grounding_seed", "system_prompt",   # untrimmed
        "created_at", "finished_at",                              # ISO str or datetime
        "model", "run_cost_usd", "run_total_tokens",
        "draft": "<full body or null>",
        "notes": [{"key", "body"}],
        "metadata": {...} | null,                                 # run_url/trace_url/total_cost_usd/…
        "egress": [{"host","port","scheme","url","bytes_out","decision","at"}],  # per-ROW (see note)
      },
      "events": [{"seq","tool","args","command","stdout","stderr","exit_code","status",
                  "duration_ms","at","reasoning","cost_usd","total_tokens","model"}],
    }

> Note on egress: this renderer needs the per-ROW egress shape (it does the by-host aggregation and
> reads `decision`/`at` for the blocked-egress flags), which REFINES the illustrative aggregated
> `[{host,count,blocked}]` sketch in the server spec. Whichever fetch backend builds the bundle must
> supply per-row egress under `run.egress`.
